## How to install Two Column

Ghost themes live in `content/themes/`
After you have downloaded Two Column, extract it and place it in content/themes alongside the Casper default theme.

To switch to your newly added theme:

 * Restart Ghost. At the moment, Ghost won't notice that you've added a new folder to content/themes so you'll need to restart it

 * Login to your Ghost admin, and navigate to `/ghost/settings/general/`

 * Select your Theme name in the 'Theme' options dropdown

 * Click 'Save'

 * Visit the frontend of your blog and marvel at the new theme

If you are new to using Ghost, we recommend checking out the following:

 * Publishing with Ghost: http://docs.ghost.org/usage/writing/

## Make Two Column your own Ghost theme

The purpose of Two Column is to make it easy for anyone to create a Ghost theme.

## Changing Sidebar Position

If you check out the `layouts` directory, we have included styling to position the sidebar either to the left of the primary content or to the right. Choosing between left or right sidebar does not interfere with responsive styling.

## What files to edit

The primary file to edit is the `default.hbs` file. This file includes the social links and footer credit links. If you are planning to create an entirely new theme, you'll need to update the following:

  * `package.json` This stores the name of the theme in Ghost.
  * `default.hbs` This file includes the social links and footer credit links that need to be updated.
  * `screen.css` We've included theme name and author information in the stylesheet.
  * You'll also need to rename the primary directory of the `two-column` theme.
